/*!
Iterator similar to the standard [fs::ReadDir] but recursive.

**WARNING** The recursive iteration of directories seems to be very fast but applied to directories
with many files and/or subdirectories can lead to panics due to **stack overflows** ðŸ’¥.
Seems like not much of the hip is being used and everything goes into the stack ðŸ”¥.
